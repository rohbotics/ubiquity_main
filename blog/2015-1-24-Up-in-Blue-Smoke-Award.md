title: The Coveted Up in Blue Smoke Award
author: Rohan Agrawal
---
Every engineering design project has failed prototypes, some of them fail because we decided that we wanted to go in a different direction, others fail more literally, going out with a flash, a bang or a puff of smoke. In electronics, we call this letting the [Blue Smoke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke) out. As letting the smoke out represents learning, we set up the much coveted Up in Blue Smoke Award.

Letting the blue smoke out is a sign that enough progress has been made on that prototype that it could fail. It also serves as a point to look back and reflect on what happened and, and how to prevent it in the future. After the post-mortem, the new winner posts about their award and how they got it on the internal website so others do not make the same mistake.
