title: Code in C Song
---
Here is a short song to the tune of Let it Be bye the Beatles, we call it Code in C.

When I find my project in lots of trouble

Kernighan and Ritchie come to me

Simple loops and functions

Code in C, code in C

And in hour of darkness 

the flow chart appears in front of me

if the project matters

Code in C

Chorus

Code in C, Code in C, Code in C, oh Code in C

if the project matters

Code in C

And when the agile scrum has meltdown

Leaving chaos in its wake

There's a simple answer

Code in C, Code in C

And though the team is panic'd

there is still a chance that they will see

there will be an answer 

Code in C, Code in C

Chorus

I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,

For science it worked flawlessly.

Try using it for graphics!

Write in C.

If you've just spent nearly 30 hours,

Debugging some assembly,

Soon you will be glad to

Write in C.

Chorus

Java's wordy, Python's nerdy

take a look and you will find

in the core compiler 

They use C, they use C

Chorus
